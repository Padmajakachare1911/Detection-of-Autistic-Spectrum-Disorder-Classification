       <h1>Detection Of Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Classification</h1>
       <h4>Welcome to the ASD Screening Tool</h4>
       <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic condition that will impact a person's behavior and how he socilaize with others. ASD appears in the early childhood but unfortunately most children diagnosed with ASD until school. Early diagnosis of ASD is significant for a family and also for the children. In this study area, we would like to know how individual characteristics have influence on ASD detection and whether the given individual characteristics are able to effectively predict the ASD cases.
       
        <p>Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time- efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behavior traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical, or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilized for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioral features (A1-A10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behavior science.</p>
        <p>This tool helps in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on individual characteristics and behavioral traits. Early diagnosis of ASD can significantly benefit the affected individuals and their families.</p>
